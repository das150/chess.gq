# Source code for chess.gq
This repository contains the source code for the chess.gq website. Since the main site is hosted on Infinity Free, a static hosting provider that does not support Node.JS, the part of chess.gq where you play the chess game is hosted externally on serveralive.herokuapp.com. The code used on the heroku site can be found under the "Heroku" folder.
